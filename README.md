### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm x, a 70% tech guy from Earth who likes to study new theories and technologies as well as very old ones. Currently I'm playing with LLMs. Below are some of my favorites. Buy me a milktea (full sugar) if they also match yours :)

- Editer: Visual Studio Code
- Programming language: C89
- Database: SQLite
- Linux distro: WSL2
- Game: Minecraft
- CSS framework: Tailwind CSS
- Web framework: none

Not because they're practical for production (some are actually far from practical), but for their symmetric and beautiful abstraction itself.

almost forgot, the other 30% are theoretical physics, music and sex.
